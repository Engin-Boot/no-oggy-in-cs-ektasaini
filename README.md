# Collections Exercise

## Intention

Oggy is a unique cat with a blue body and green eyes.
Thus, this program intends to remove strings containing 'oggy' from a list of strings.

## Solution

In c# we cannot remove elements from a list while iterating through it .
One possible solution is to iterate backwards,
which does not skip anything and we can call 'RemoveAt' method for removing elements.
The code works according to the intention.
